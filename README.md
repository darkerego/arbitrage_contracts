# Arbitrage Smart Contracts


# about
<p>
This is a smart contract written in Solidity that is capable of doing dual and tri dex trades across uniswap v2 fork dexes. 
Contract supports DODO flash loans. 
Code inspired by James Bachini's dex arbitrage, see https://jamesbachini.com/dex-arbitrage/
</p>

<p>
Disclaimer: I only started writing Solidity a couple of months ago and this code is probably not very great and although 
I have tried to follow best practice there could be security issues, as it has not been audited by a professional.
